So you want to move into the data field but are unsure where to focus your energy? Look no further!

Firstly let's investigate the most popular programming langauges in data jobs in Berlin.

![Fig 1 - Programming languages](proglang.png)

It's pretty clear that Python and SQL are the most in demand skills, with a whopping 37% and 32% of all data jobs asking for these skills respectively. The gender-diverse Kings and Queens of data analysis reign supreme! Now this may not be a huge surprise, but what is also interesting to note is the runners up:

- **Java** - Used often big data data processing and analysis (efficient and scalable).
- **Scala** - Used for solving big data problems (the language chosen by Apache Spark and works well with Java).
- **R** - Is a statistical powerhouse with comprehensive ecosystem of packages for analysis, visualisation and ML.
- **C++** - Used for high power processing due to it's resource effiency (e.g. high frequency trading, complex simulations).

**Open-source alert!**: Notice how the only two closed-source languages are Matlab and SAS.

Let's move onto data analysis tools...

Here most people will know Tableau and Excel but what about the other tools?

- **Spark** - Apache Spark is a scalable data analysis tool.
- **Airflow** -  Apache Airflow allow for scheduling and monitoring workflows (e.g. machine learning pipelines).
- **Databricks** - Databricks is a data warehousing and AI tool (interestingly it was founded by the creators of Apache Spark).

What's the deal with all this "Apache"? Well, it's part of the [Apache Software Foundation](https://apache.org/) producing cutting edge open-source (and often **free**) software solutions for many different applications. 

**Open-source alert again!**: With all this free and open-source software (FOSS) around, it's almost surprising that Tableau is still kicking around in the most demanded tools, even though it is propreitary and closed-source, costing around €500-€1000 per year. I doubt this will be for long and predict Tableau to be superceded by a FOSS equivalent within the next 5 years. What do you think?

Finally... let's check out the Python packages most in demand in 2024:

What do all these Python packages do? Well Pytorch, Tensorflow and Keras are all deep learning and AI packages for complex machine learning problems. Pandas is your everyday data handling tool, scikitlearn your basic ML tool and matplotlib is used for visualisations.

**TLDR**: If you want a data job in Berlin in 2024, learn Python, SQL and one Apache tool (like Spark or Airflow) and consider becoming a data engineer!
