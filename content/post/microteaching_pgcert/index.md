This video lecture was part of the Post-graduate Certificate I completed in 2023, focusing on digital pedagogies in practice. Part of this involved critical evaluating digital tools for collabaorative learning. Here we looked at diagrams.net, a open-source, cloud-based diagramming software. If you're an educator or facilitator this tool would certainly be of interest to you!

Here's [the site](https://www.drawio.com/) if you want to try it out yourself.
